# Claude Code on the web — environment setup script (versioned source of truth).
#
# WHAT: installs the prerequisites a cloud session needs but the base image
# doesn't ship (the Flutter SDK, which the executable requirements in
# dev/requirements and `flutter analyze` depend on), and records a version flag
# the SessionStart hook validates.
#
# HOW TO USE: copy the FULL contents of this file into the environment's
# "Setup script" field (web UI -> environment selector -> edit environment ->
# Setup script). It runs once when an environment is first used; Anthropic then
# snapshots the filesystem, so later sessions already have Flutter on disk — the
# install is NOT repaid per session, and it does NOT belong in a SessionStart
# hook.
#
# VERSIONING: bump ENV_SETUP_VERSION whenever this script changes. The
# SessionStart hook (.claude/hooks/check-environment.sh) compares the version
# recorded on disk against this number and alerts if the environment is unset or
# stale, prompting the user to re-paste this script and restart their session.
