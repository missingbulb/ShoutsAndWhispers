// Technology pack: building on Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Cloud Functions,
// FCM) — schema/rules discipline, function patterns, testing without live
// infrastructure, and deploy layout. Fingerprint: firebase.json — the config
// every Firebase repo carries — at the repo root OR one directory down (a
// monorepo's firebase/ project root), but never deeper, so a firebase.json in
// a nested fixture/example tree can't trip detection. A Firebase project root
// is the directory that holds firebase.json, not necessarily the repo root.

  ctx.tracked.some((f) => {
    const parts = f.split('/');
    return parts[parts.length - 1] === marker && parts.length <= 2;
  });

// The release standard (skills/create-release-plan) — the dev/prod project split,
// pipeline-injected prod config and App Check gating — is a skill rather than
// prose: it is read when a project plans its release, not on every session.
